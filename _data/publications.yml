- title: Research and Development of an Artificial Neural Network for Spectral Data
  description: >-
    Research into various neural networks to predict the state of storage containers of nuclear waste.
    This is done by introducing vibrations in the containers and measuring the residual frequencies.
    These get decomposed into frequency components which form the input of the researched models.
