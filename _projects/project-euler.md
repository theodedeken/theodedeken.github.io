description: >-
    Project Euler is a website hosting a bunch of mathematically inspired problems.
    These can be solved by writing an algorithm.
    I have solved quite a lot of problems netting me a place in the top 1% of all solvers.

Project Euler is a problem solving challenge website where new problems are posted each week.
A problem is often mathematically inspired and the answer is always a single number.
To find this number you need to write an efficient algorithm.

I have currently solved this many problems:

Which puts me in the **top 1%** of all users on the website.
## Benchmarks
I have benchmarked my solutions in both time and memory.
Project Euler states that each problem is solvable in less than a minute with the right algorithm.
As you can see most of my problems fulfill this requirement, with only a few problematic problems.
