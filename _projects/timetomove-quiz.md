During my volunteering work in Sweden we participated in the [Time to Move](https://timetomove.eurodesk.eu/) event. 
This event aims to inspire youths to travel within the EU as part of various programs such as Erasmus, European Solidarity corps and more.

One of the activities we hosted was an online quiz. 
Due to the prohibitive pricing of typeform and the lack of feature in google forms at the time I decided to implement the quiz as a custom [svelte](https://svelte.dev/) app.
