From September 2019 to March 2020 I went to Sweden as a volunteer as part of the [European Solidarity Corps](https://europa.eu/youth/solidarity_en).
During my time there I created a series of workshops called [Game I/O](https://hubben-amal.github.io/game-io-workshops/).

The workshops covered the basics of game development for the web using [Phaser](https://phaser.io/).
Handling topics such as:

* Programming in Javascript
* Rendering sprites
* Making pixel art
* Using the physics engine
* Adding music and sounds

Development was done solely on the web, using web editors such as [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) and [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/).
All presentations and exercises were hosted on a [github pages website](https://hubben-amal.github.io/game-io-workshops/) built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
